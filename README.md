# Opioid Data Analysis


What is the U.S. Opioid Epidemic?
In the late 1990s, pharmaceutical companies reassured the medical community that patients would not become addicted to opioid pain relievers and healthcare providers began to prescribe them at greater rates.

Increased prescription of opioid medications led to widespread misuse of both prescription and non-prescription opioids before it became clear that these medications could indeed be highly addictive.

# Stage I   - Data Understanding and Linking
In this stage we utilize multiple publicly available datasets and link them together for analytics. Our goal here is to help identify patterns which contribute to drug overdose deaths. Within this notebook we will explore:

Creating Index - Developing an index key for linking datasets
Join - Using join to merge data based on index key.
The notebooks is viewable via any browser.

# Stage II  - Data Modeling
The goal of Stage II is to develop the data for modeling and comparative analysis. Here you will be graphically comparing how different states are doing with respect to opioid mortality rate. And you will be also analysing county based information for different states in the US.

# Stage III - Distributions and Hypothesis Testing 
The goal of Stage III is to develop advanced data for modeling for comparative analysis and hypothesis testing.

# Stage IV  - Dashboard
The final stage aims a developing a simple interactive dashboard based on the analysis you have done so far. In this we will be utilizing Plotly (https://plotly.com/) along with Dash (https://plotly.com/dash/) as our framework.
